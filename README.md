# Machine learning exercise from deeplearning.ai course

# Frank - Deep Neural Network - Step by Step.ipynb contains the jupyter notebook for building the components of a machine learning module
## it references dnn_utils.py, which contains helper methods such as sigmoid and relu

# Frank - Deep Neural Network - Cat vs Non-Cat.ipynb contains the jupyter for building a complete application for recognizing cat vs non-cat
## it references dnn_app_utils.py, which contains helper method such as L_model_backward that pieces together multiple layers of linear_activation_backward as implemented in the Frank - Deep Neural Network - Step by Step.ipynb
